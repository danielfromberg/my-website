  I am an artist working across mediums, asking questions about contemporary listening: how is listening enacted in the world today, as the accumulation of a personal listening history, as influenced by 100+ years of market forces and technological development, as sense and habit formed over time?  How can sound be used as a model for wider sociocultural issues of communication, or the alienation precluding it, between and within communities?

  My sound practice began at an early age through guitar lessons and obsessions with musical objects and ephemera, rescuing children's sound toys and cassette technology from basements and garage sales. Since age 10, I have been recording and performing original music. As a preteen, I released two tapes on the Chicago Teen River label, performed twice on the public access institution Chic-A-Go-Go as well as at Chicago venues including The Burlington, Township, Cafe Mustache, Permanent Records, Bric-A-Brac Records, and the Empty Bottle.

  In the present, I study Visual and Critical studies and Sound at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, write, create music and multimedia art, record myself and others, work as a sound recordist and postproduction mixer for film, program my own performance software, and co-edit a new multimedia art website, <a href="https://mementos.tk" target="_blank">Mementos</a>. In the near future, I hope to teach sound and music to young people in a freeform, creative way that doesn't present financial boundaries.
